# Power-BI-Dashboard-and-EDA-Students-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview

Data cleaning and EDA performed in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) followed by
an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore drivers of student outcomes,
provide reproducible EDA code and deliver interactive visualizations for data-driven insights.

## Tools

- Power BI
- Python
- Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – analysis & presentation

## Key Outcomes

- Cleaned and prepared the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values and treating outliers.
- Conducted EDA in Python to understand student performance patterns across gender, parental education, lunch type and test preparation course completion.
- Identified that higher parental education and completion of the test preparation course are strongly linked to improved scores across all subjects.
- Discovered significant score differences between genders, with females generally outperforming males in reading and writing.
- Analyzed the correlation between reading, writing and math scores, revealing a strong linear relationship between reading and writing performance.
- Segmented students into low, medium and high performers using Pandas logic.
- Built an interactive and insight-driven Power BI dashboard.
- Transformed raw data into actionable educational insights to support data-driven academic strategies.
